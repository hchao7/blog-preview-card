## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM Methodology
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to make websites responsive without using media queries. For example, I used `clamp()` to resize the font-size and width based on the viewport. This method ensures that both properties shrink to the mobile sizes and expand to the desktop sizes specified by the design file.

I gained more experience using Flexbox. To write cleaner CSS, I used Flexbox to distribute space between and within elements, rather than relying on margins or padding. For example, the child elements inside `.card_content` are spaced apart using the `gap` property.

```css
.card__content {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 12px;
  min-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```

### Continued development

This project specified reducing font-size for smaller screens without using media queries. I used `clamp()`, which resizes the font-size gradually. Next time, Iâ€™d like to use media queries so there is an instant transition from the desktop font-size to mobile font-size once the viewport reaches a certain width. 

### Useful resources
